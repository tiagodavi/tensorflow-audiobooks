## Neural Network to predict whether a user is likely to buy an audio book again.

### I took raw data:

- Which should not make a lot of sense to anyone who is not in this business 

- Where many variables were binary 

- Had missing values 

- Where the orders of magnitude had nothing in common 

### Technologies: 

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn
